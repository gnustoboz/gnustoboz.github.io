    So maybe you landed here after seeing my bio on one site or another, or followed an old link from a game jam or project writeup.
</div>
<div class="copy">
    Short version is I write code for a living, I write other kinds of code for fun, and I write the occasional prose. I'm working on some things of my own these days, but nothing I'm posting about at this point.
</div>
<div class="copy">
    While I no longer maintain my old game jam writeups, I have <a href="/#games">some information here</a> about my game jamming days, and for those who might have run across me on the Twine scene in times past, I've got <a href="/#twine">some details about that as well</a>. If you've followed a dead link from somewhere and have any questions about something I did in either of those areas that isn't posted anymore, just <a href="/#contact">let me know</a> and I'm sure I've got it around here somewhere.
</div>
<div class="copy">
    Otherwise, hey &mdash; have fun, stay safe out there, and you know <a href="/#contact">where to find me</a>.
