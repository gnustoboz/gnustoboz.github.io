                Those of us who used Twine 1.x and exported stories in Twee format as part of a larger
                workflow were disappointed to find that Twine 2.0 no longer had that feature. I created Entweedle as a
                <a href="https://onegameamonth.com/">One Game a Month</a> project for my own use and for anyone else who
                needed it. Playing a story with Entweedle set as its story format will display Twee format source code
                for your story.

                However, this capability was eventually added to Twine 2.x, so this story format is probably obsolete.
                It's maintained here in case there's any other use for it.

                More of an experiment, Illume is a proofing story format for collaborators. It generates a file which
                can be saved and passed off to a reviewer or proofreader.
                <span class="interactor" onclick="MV.showLightbox('/assets/images/illumeEditView.png'); return false;">This "Illumation" of the story</span>
                keeps track of which passages have been reviewed, and allows the reader to make changes to any passage.
                When finished, the reader can export 
                <span class="interactor" onclick="MV.showLightbox('/assets/images/illumeChangeList.png'); return false;">a document that details all of proposed changes</span>,
                which the author in turn can go through like a checklist to revise their story.

                While this generally works as intended, the process is still inconvenient due to the limitations of
                being a story format, since there's no direct way of incorporating the changes back into the original
                story. Anything more graceful, however, would probably require a version of Twine with shared,
                server-stored stories and multiple users, which is obviously a very large and fundamental change to how
                Twine works, so I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for that.

                While participating in two creative challenges, <a href="https://www.nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a> and 
                <a href="https://onegameamonth.com/">One Game a Month</a>, I had the ill-advised notion that I would combine
                the two challenges by, in the span of one month, writing a new story of at least 50,000 words for NaNoWriMo
                that was playable as an interactive fiction story for 1GAM. The result is "A Penitent Man," an interactive
                interview between a medium and a dead man.

            <div class="copy">
                In light of the time constraints, the story received essentially no proofreading, no editing, and no corrections.
                At the time I jokingly described this story as "naked pictures of my brain on the internet" and that still feels
                accurate. I don't dare break the seal now, so these decade-old typos and clumsy phrasings will just have to do.

                In the midst of my gamejamming era, I came across a jam on the then-official Twine forums where the goal was to create a Twine story in 10 days having less than 1,000 total words. This time I experimented with embedding a Twine story in an existing web page. I figured the least Twine-like thing I could do is incorporate some sort of active elements, so I put together a page with a layered scrolling view out a window and some background sound, embedded the story format code, and plugged the updated Twine story elements into the page whenever I exported it.
            </div>
            <div class="copy">
                The combination of an existing page and a Twine export worked as intended, so that was a win. The story itself has a looping structure to make the most of its limited permitted word count, and while it's a little barebones, I think it at least managed to achieve a certain vibe.
